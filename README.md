# React UI

My Personal implementation for React UI Boilerplate

## Dev

`npm run dev`

- Dev Server - [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)

## Tech

This dev build contains the following:

**Front-End**

- React
- styled-components

## Build Process

I believe creating your own boilerplate a necessity to understanding what you're actually building. You don't have to go too indepth to realize how/why certain tech has been added and what I wanted to achieve with this build.

### Webpack

- A straight forward two round systems that gives us a Development server and a Production server. We merge them together using a `common.js` file that way we have the same processes use the same modules and configs.

### Styled Components

- Although I had heard of `styled-components` since 2017(?) I didn't really start seeing actual results until recently. In that time I was able to see the true power of it. In my company we use a variety of styling systems, but `styled-components` has allowed us to develop faster. This could always change for a better system mostly anything that will allow us to get faster in developing.

## Future

- This boilerplate exemplifies my current knowledgebase. I'd be lying to say that I know everything. I'm sure that there are better developers out there who know more than me or develop in a much more "safe" environment. But honestly this is all about the learning process. We should always be learning.

### TypeScript

- I want to explore the idea of having typeScript dictate how we communicate with the backend. I don't know if this would lend itself to creating a better environment but rather a "safe" environment.
- I don't have enough technical knowledge to decide _how_ fast this would make my env. I would rather keep it within my own knowledge realm.
